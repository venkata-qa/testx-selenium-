Rules for Merging Steps:
- Number of data table's columns should be equal to the number of arguments in a step (Except page name)

1. If you have multiple click operations on the same page, use the following line to merge them:

When I click the following elements on <Page_Name>
| Col_name  |
| Element1  |
| Element2  |
Column should be one.

2. If you have multiple enter-related steps on the same page, use the following line to merge them:

When I enter the data for the following fields on "<Page_Name>"
| Col_name1         | Col_name2       |
| FieldName1        | Value1          |
| FieldName2        | Value2          |
Columns should be two.

3. If you have multiple hover-related steps on the same page, use the following line to merge them:

Given I hover on following element on <Page_Name>
| Col_name1 |
| Element1  |
| Element2  |
Column should be one.

4. If you have multiple assertion-related steps on the same page, use the following line to merge them:

And I assert the following elements on <Page_Name>
| Col_name1         | Col_name2      |
| Element1          | Expected_Text1 |
| Element2          | Expected_Text2 |

5. If you have distinct steps that should not be merged, keep them separate in the Gherkin scenario.
