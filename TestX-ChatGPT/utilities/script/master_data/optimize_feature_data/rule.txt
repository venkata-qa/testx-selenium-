We are expecting below type of enhanced feature file with combined steps. Only in case we have similar subsequent steps.

Scenario:S1-As a registered user, user should be able to logged in

    Given I am in App main site
    And I enter the data for the following fields on the "LoginPage"
      | fieldName     | data          |
      | usernameInput | standard_user |
      | passwordInput | secret_sauce  |
    When I click the following elements on the "LoginPage"
      | fieldName   |
      | loginButton |
      | HomeButton  |
      |ProfileButton|
    And I verify the text of the following fields on the "HomePage"
      | fieldName     | fieldText  |
      | productsMain1 | Products1  |
      | productsMain2 | Products2  |
      | productsMain3 | Products3  |

Apply this rule for all type of operations, Means create a common step if we have similar subsequent steps.
